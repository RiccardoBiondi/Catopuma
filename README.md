## Overview

CATOPUMA is a Python package that offers customizable advanced TensorFlow and Torch objects for tasks such as preprocessing, uploading, modeling, and augmenting. It includes several classes that facilitate the loading, augmentation, and preprocessing of images for deep learning models. The vast majprity of these objects are agnostic and can worok both for tensorflow, keras and pytorch.


The main functionalities of CATOPUMA are as follows:

  - Feeder: This module contains classes to helps load images batch-wise from local directories and eventuallly perform data augmentation and image preprocessing on the fly.

  - Losses: The losses module provide a series of custom losses. The overload if the arimetic operators allows to easy combine different losses.

  - Preprocessing: CATOPUMA provides the implementation of some classes to easily perform the basic preprocessing steps on images and labels

  - Augmentation: CATOPUMA provides some classes to easily perform data augmentation.
  These classes are mainly based on albumentations.

  - Core: the core functionality of catopÃ¨uma are the bastract classess providing a base for each of the basic functionality (like preprocessin, loss, data augmentation, etc.), allowing an easy customization of the various objects.

Overall, CATOPUMA simplifies the process of preparing image datasets for deep learning models by providing convenient classes and functions for loading, augmenting, and preprocessing images

## Installation

CATOPUMA offers different installation way.
The installation process is the same for each Operative System.

Supported python version: ![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8|3.9|3.10|3.11-blue.svg).

CATOPUMA work for both tensorflow.keras and pytorch but does not autoamatically install them.
Before install this project plaese make sure that at least one of them is installed.


### Install with pip

pip installer is not yet available

### Install with conda

conda installer is no yet availabel

### Install from source

  Download the project or the latest release:

  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/RiccardoBiondi/Catopuma
  ```

  Now  install the required packages:

  ```console
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  And you are ready to build the package:

  ```console
  python setup.py develop --user
  ```


### Select Default Framework

Once you have installed CATOPUMA, you can specify which framework it should be use.
If only one of tensorflow.keras and pytorch is installed, then it is automatically stted as default.
If both are installed, you can specify which one use as deafult by setting the environment variable `CATOPUMA_FRAMEWORK` to `torch` or `tf.keras`
  
- on **Ubuntu**:
```console 
export CATOPUMA_FRAMEWORK=your_framework
```

- on **Windows**:

```console
$env:CATOPUMA_FRAMEWORK = 'your_framwork'
```

### Testing

We have provide a test routine in [test](./test) directory. This routine use:

- pytest >= 3.0.7

- hypothesis >= 4.13.0

Please install these packages to perform the test.
You can run the full set of test with:

```console
  python -m pytest
```

## Getting Started

Once you have installed the 

### Basic Usage

### Chenge Framework

The default framework is keras (if installed on your system or environment), however it is possible to work also with pytorch or tensorflow.keras.
Moreover, it is possible
